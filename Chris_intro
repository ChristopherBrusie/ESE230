Hi, my name is chris. I am excited to join the Pi Lab!

yes, setting up the Pi was not difficult. 

This is not my first experience with the Pi. I design/build autonomous drones using Pis. 

I am familiar with the linux environment. I've used RasPi OS, and Ubuntu on these machines. 

I have experience with python, I took ESE205 which is largely based on python. 7 on a scale of 1-10. I have recieved an A on a college level python course. 

No questions, from me, I'm excited to get started!
